h2. customization

h3. replace the iphone icon

!http://img.skitch.com/20081020-ddke2pitkd6qpkrtrn3shi9ji.png!

i added three replacement icons, green, blue and grey, with grey being the default. if you'd like to use blue, modify line 10 of basicpage_mini.html to instead read:

<pre><link href='/m/images/icon-touch-blue.png' rel='apple-touch-icon' /></pre>

if you want the indigo default icon back, change that same line to:

<pre><link href='/apple-touch-icon.png' rel='apple-touch-icon' /></pre>

h3. create a mini desktop app with fluid

!http://img.skitch.com/20081122-qda98w4uatj896dnphsh9t8suj.png!

* create a new SSB for your control server
* copy and paste the stylesheet FROM: 
  <pre>cd /Library/"Application Support"/"Perceptive Automation"/"Indigo 2"/IndigoWebServer/m/css/mini-fluid.css</pre>
   TO the Userstyles option in your new SSB's preferences.

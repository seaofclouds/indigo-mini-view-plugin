   TO the Userstyles option in your new SSB's preferences.

more information about fluid at: "http://fluidapp.com/":http://fluidapp.com/ and similar instructions for customizing userstyles at: "http://code.google.com/p/darkbutgood/wiki/HowToInstallDarkButGood":http://code.google.com/p/darkbutgood/wiki/HowToInstallDarkButGood

h3. replace the iphone icon

!http://img.skitch.com/20081020-ddke2pitkd6qpkrtrn3shi9ji.png!

i added three replacement icons, green, blue and grey, with grey being the default. if you'd like to use blue, modify line 10 of basicpage_mini.html to instead read:

<pre><link href='/m/images/icon-touch-blue.png' rel='apple-touch-icon' /></pre>

if you want the indgigo default icon back, change that same line to:

<pre><link href='apple-touch-icon.png' rel='apple-touch-icon' /></pre>

h2. uninstalling

if you believe that these replacement views are the cause of errors, simply delete the "m" directory, restart your server, and you're good to go!
